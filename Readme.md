# Simple ODE Simulation

This project simulates a system of two masses connected by springs and visualizes their motion using Python.

## Features
- Solves a system of differential equations using `solve_ivp`
- Plots displacement and velocity of masses over time
- Creates an animation of the masses' motion

## Dependencies
Ensure you have the following libraries installed:
```bash
pip install numpy scipy matplotlib
```

## Usage
Run the script in a Jupyter Notebook or Python environment to:
1. Solve the equations numerically
2. Generate plots of system behavior
3. Create an animated visualization

## File Structure
- `photo.png`: Optional image for display
- `my-anime.gif`: Animation output
- `script.py`: Main Python script containing the ODE solver and visualization

## Notes
- Ensure `photo.png` is in the same directory if using the `Image()` function.
- The animation is saved as `my-anime.gif`.
